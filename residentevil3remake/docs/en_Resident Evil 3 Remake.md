# Resident Evil 3 Remake

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Most items/weapons/keys in the game have been shuffled around, and you may have to fight enemies with loadouts you'd
previously be unaccustomed. 

Goal is stop Nikolai on the NEST Rooftop. You'll have to find the various keys needed scattered throughout the world/s 
to make it through the story, beat Nemesis and get to the Rooftop for the final confrontation.   

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item, a message will appear in the upper left corner of the screen. 
This message may slightly differ depending on if you're in range of an item box.

## Will the DLC to get Bolt Cutters/Lock Pick early ruin my randomizer experience?

While I'm strongly against their use, to each their own. It'll remove nearly all backtracking if kept on.
Feel free to disable it within your DLC manager of Steam if you don't want them. 
You'll have to look up how to disable it on other platforms since I don't own them. 
To note, the in-game purchaseable versions cannot be disabled and you'd have to delete your data to remove them.
